# About
## ___Dakya is a text adventure about a girl in a mystical world.___

<br>

# Motivation
This is a project for my daughter and me. <br>
It exists to show my daughter how coding works, what my job looks like and what it takes to develop a game.

# Limitations
Right now there is no serious idea to earn money with this game. <br>
Therefore I set the following limitiations to the game, just to limit the effort for this father daughter project:


- At least 100 questions / interactions but also round about a maximum of them to bring the story to an end.
- The player name is fix
- No usage of input fields in this game
- No libs in this project for the game, maybe for the dev process
- Pure vanilla js, html and css
- No statistics for the GAME OVER / YOU WIN Screen
- One html page to show text and enable interactions
- Release as static page (maybe netlify)
- Post link to released game here in github
- The story is written in german only, no translations planned

Further game ideas I do not intend to develop now.
